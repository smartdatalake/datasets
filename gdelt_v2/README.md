# GDELT Articles Graph

## Overview

This page provides instructions and source code for producing a Heterogeneous Information Network of news articles and associated information about mentioned organizations and persons from data obtained from the [GDELT](https://www.gdeltproject.org/) project.

## Instructions

To download data from GDELT, run the bash script `fetch_data.sh`, with argument the desired date with no dashes. For example, to download the data from 1st April, 2019, run the command `./fetch_data.sh 20190401`. This will download all .zip files from this day, unzip them and combine them in one big file, named `20190401_raw.txt`.

To download data inside a date range, run the python script `batch.py`, with arguments the desired start_date & end_date (included). For example, to download the data from 1st April, 2019 to 13th April, 2019, run the command `python batch.py 2019-04-01 2019-04-13`.

To import the data into a [NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io/) graph, run the `extract_data.py` with the same argument. For example, to import the data from 1st April, 2019, run the command `python extract_data.py 20190401`. This will create two files, a filtered version of the previous raw file named `20190401_filtered.csv` and a gpickle for the Networkx graph named `20190401_graph.gpickle`.

## Data description

The figure below depicts the schema of the produced graph.

The following table shows the number of graph nodes and edges for each type, based on the data of 1st April, 2019:

| Node | Number |
| --- | --- |
| Article | 215,739 |
| Person | 189,833 |
| Organization | 119,588 |
| Theme | 10,690 |
| Location | 31,267 |
| Source | 13,091 |
| **Total** | **580,208** |

| Edge | Number |
| --- | --- |
| ART_PER | 732,334 |
| ART_ORG | 543,441 |
| ART_THM | 5,140,224 |
| ART_LOC | 658,494 |
| ART_SRC | 223,668 |
| **Total** | **7,298,161** |

Each filtered .csv file has no header, since the user might want to concatenate the files. The columns of the files are:

1. aid: Article Id, unique for each article.
2. url: Original url of article.
